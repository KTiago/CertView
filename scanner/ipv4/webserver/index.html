    <h1>CertWatch Project</h1>
    	<p> We are researchers in the field of computer security currently conducting internet wide scans to collect TLS certificates on port 443. The collected data is not used for any malicious purpose. </p>
	<p> Our scan consists in a TCP SYN scan to discover hosts reponsive on port 443 on the entire IPv4 range followed by a TLS handshake to collect the certificates from reponsive hosts. </p>
        <p> The scan is purposefully spread over time in order to limit any negative impact. The order of hosts is chosen randomly to evenly distribute the load, resulting in any /16 IPv4 range being subject to less than 1 TCP SYN packet (and TLS handshake) every 2 seconds. </p>
        <p> If nonetheless you want your subnetwork to be excluded from future scan from our project, please send an email to <a href="mailto:abuse.certview@gmail.com">abuse.certview@gmail.com</a> with the list of subnetworks to be blacklisted and we will promptly honor your request.</p>
